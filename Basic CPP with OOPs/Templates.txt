Why templates?

DRY Rule:
To understand the reason behind using templates, we will have to 
understand the effort behind declaring classes for different data types. 
Suppose we want to have a vector for each of the three(can be more) 
data types, int, float and char. Then we’ll obviously write the 
whole thing again and again making it awfully difficult. 
This is where the saviour comes, the templates. 
It helps parametrizing the data type and declaring it once in the 
source code suffice. Very similar to what we do in functions. 
It is because of this, also called, ‘parameterized classes’.

Generic Programming:
It is called generic, because it is sufficient to declare a template once, 
it becomes general and it works all along for all the data types
